# Scala Template

This is the Scala template for the ID2202 course. Like the other templates,
building happens with `make`, running with `./hello`. The project is built using
[`sbt`](https://www.scala-sbt.org/), which you thus must have installed on your
machine.

To use this template for an assignment, rename `hello` to the name of your
executable. If the executable should be called `calc`, then run:
```bash
mv hello calc
```

Put all your source files in `src`.
